Haji Muhammad Amin Pardesi took over his family's textile business in 1982, which his father, Haji Abdul Rahim Giga, had established in 1956. Haji Muhammad Amin Pardesi strategically focused on non-traditional and non-quota regions like Africa for trade in textiles, made-ups, and machinery. Under his leadership, Mian Akber Trading Corporation in Pakistan has won the Largest Exporter to Non-Quota Countries award for the past 17 years.

Haji Muhammad Amin Pardesi believes in challenges. Under his captaincy, the company carved out a name in the African market with a unit in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, employing a workforce of over 5,000 that earned the appreciation of the President of Tanzania for its contribution to the Tanzanian economy. In 1994, he ventured into the bullion market by establishing Mazyood Jewellery LLC in the UAE. Soon, it became one of the leading traders of bullion in the UAE and the subcontinent.

The excellent working relationship with Union Bank of Switzerland Warburg brought Mazyood Jewellery the title of the most active client of the year 2000. Ever enterprising, Haji Amin established Al Ghurair Giga Gold Refinery in 2003 at the Dubai Multi-Commodity Centre (DMCC) in the UAE. The project is a joint venture between Al Ghurair Group and Giga Group. Haji Amin then entered the arena of construction and property development and established enterprises in Pakistan and the UAE.

He established joint ventures with EMAAR, one of the largest property developers in the world, and Al Ghurair Group, one of the most prominent groups in the UAE, with businesses all over the world.

Besides his remarkable business acumen and success, Haji Amin is also known for his philanthropy. He encourages the young and deserving by providing them with opportunities for higher education and personally devotes significant time to mentoring them.

Today, all Giga Group Companies have the privilege of the leadership of Haji Amin.
