Residential properties tend to perform well in stable or growing neighborhoods with high demand for housing.

Residential properties are typically less volatile and have lower barriers to entry. Commercial properties, while potentially more profitable, require a higher risk tolerance due to market sensitivity and management complexities.\n\nFinancial Preparedness: Ensure you have the financial capacity to invest.
